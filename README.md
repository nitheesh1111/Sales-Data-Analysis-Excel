# Sales-Data-Analysis-Excel
Basic sales data analysis using Excel

**Project Summary:**
In this project, I analyzed a sample sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. I applied basic formulas to
calculate total sales for each order, used filters to explore data by category and region, and created
bar charts to visualize total sales by region. I identified key insights such as the best-performing
product, most profitable region, and total revenue. This project helped me strengthen my skills in
Excel functions, data filtering, and data visualization for business decision-making.


**Key Insights:**
• Watch was the highest revenue-generating product (₹5000).
• East region had the highest total sales.
• Accessory category performed better than Clothing.
• Total revenue generated: ₹12,800.
• Average product price: ₹1414.29.
